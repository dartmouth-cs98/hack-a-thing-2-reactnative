#Hack-a-Thing-2 September 2018

#Overview
I attempted to build a React Native application since I had never worked with React Native before.

#Who
Amara Gordon

#Learnings
I spent a lot of time on setup and debugging, but I was proud that I could not only pull from the knowledge on stackoverflow about npm and brew, but that I could work through some of the bugs on my own to figure them out.

#Inspiration for the Future
Because I am thinking about creating a mobile app, this makes me want to learn even more about react native especially because React Native is used so widely today for mobile app development.

#What Didn't Work
I tried to follow the tutorial from CS 52, and some of the code broke my project, so I am working on debugging.
